# ‚öôÔ∏è Crossplane AWS Resource Lifecycle Controller

This project showcases a **production-grade platform engineering controller** built on Kubernetes and Crossplane. It automates the lifecycle of **ephemeral AWS infrastructure**, such as S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables, based on TTL (time-to-live) logic defined at the claim level.

This is part of a larger project: Building a cloud-agnostic developer self-service platform with Crossplane, ArgoCD, AWS, and Terraform.
